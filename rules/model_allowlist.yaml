outputs:
  pass_criteria: len(NONCOMPLIANT_MODELS)==0
  signals:
  - NONCOMPLIANT_MODELS
  - TOTAL_MODELS
remediation:
  playbook: model_access_control@v1
  guidance: Block non-allowlisted models via APIM/egress controls.
rationale:
  business_value: Reduces regulatory, ethical, and operational risk; improves trust
    and audit readiness.
  threats_mitigated:
  - Regulatory non-compliance
  - Data leakage
  - Unfair outcomes
  - Service disruptions
severity_mapping:
  pass:

    action: record
  warn:
    severity: medium
    action: monitor_and_plan
  fail:
    severity: high
    action: remediate_or_block
scoring:
  weight_default: 0.05
  calculation: 1.0 for pass; 0.5 for warn; 0.0 for fail
  aggregation: weighted_mean_across_controls
exemptions:
  allowed: true
  policy: Temporary exemptions require risk acceptance and expiration date.

evaluation:
  logic_notes: Engine computes signals from evidence; evaluates pass_criteria; maps
    to status; emits Finding with signals and remediation.
  pseudocode:
  - signals = compute_signals(evidence, params)
  - status = evaluate(pass_criteria, signals, params)
  - emit_finding(status, rationale, signals, remediation)
evidence_schemas:
  blob_uri.json:
    hint: JSON array or object with fields referenced by the rule (see signals)
  inline.json:
    hint: Direct JSON payload provided by agent/evaluator
examples:
  good: All metrics within thresholds; complete artifacts; no violations found.
  bad: Missing audit logs and TLS <1.2 on one endpoint; non-allowlisted model detected.
risk_context:
  impact: Use of unvetted models increases risk
  likelihood: Medium
signals_details:
  NONCOMPLIANT_MODELS: Models not on allowlist
