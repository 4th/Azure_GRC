  guidance: Publish model purpose, data use, risks, and human oversight details.
rationale:
  business_value: Reduces regulatory, ethical, and operational risk; improves trust
    and audit readiness.
  threats_mitigated:
  - Regulatory non-compliance
  - Data leakage
  - Unfair outcomes
  - Service disruptions

evaluation:
  logic_notes: Engine computes signals from evidence; evaluates pass_criteria; maps
    to status; emits Finding with signals and remediation.
  pseudocode:
  - signals = compute_signals(evidence, params)
  - status = evaluate(pass_criteria, signals, params)
  - emit_finding(status, rationale, signals, remediation)
evidence_schemas:
  blob_uri.json:
    hint: JSON array or object with fields referenced by the rule (see signals)
  inline.json:
    hint: Direct JSON payload provided by agent/evaluator
examples:
  good: All metrics within thresholds; complete artifacts; no violations found.
  bad: Missing audit logs and TLS <1.2 on one endpoint; non-allowlisted model detected.
risk_context:
  impact: Loss of user trust; regulatory flags
  likelihood: Medium
signals_details:
  CHANNEL_GAPS: Disclosure channels lacking required info
