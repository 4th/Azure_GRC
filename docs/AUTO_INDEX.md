# 📘 4th.GRC Documentation Auto-Index

This file is a **human-friendly map** of the `docs/` directory for the 4th.GRC™ platform.

In the future, this index can be auto-generated by a script (for example, extending `gen_api_pages.py` or adding a `render_docs_index.py`), but this version is curated to match your current layout.

## 🔍 Index by Category

### 1. API & Integration

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `API.md` | High-level overview of the 4th.GRC API surface (how clients integrate). |
| `api/` | Contains generated per-endpoint API reference pages. |
| `gen_api_pages.py` | Python script that generates docs under `docs/api/` from the OpenAPI schema or live service. |

---

### 2. Architecture

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` | Describes the overall system architecture: PolicyEngine service, Scorecard app, agents, data stores, and Azure components. |

---

### 3. Governance & Policy-as-Code

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `GOVERNANCE_PLAYBOOK.md` | Governance operating model (roles, RACI, review cadence, escalation paths). |
| `SCHEMA_POLICY_PROFILE.md` | Defines the expected structure of a Policy Profile (fields, metadata, rules, mappings). |
| `MODEL_CARD_TEMPLATE.md` | Template for documenting AI/ML models used in governed systems (risks, mitigations, datasets, metrics). |
| `SYSTEM_CARD.md` | Describes a specific AI system under governance (purpose, context, risks, scores, and results from PolicyEngine). |

## 🧠 How `gen_api_pages.py` Fits In

- `gen_api_pages.py` is responsible for **materializing endpoint-level docs** under `docs/api/`, typically by:
  - Reading an OpenAPI schema (e.g., `docs/api/openapi.json` or the live FastAPI app)
  - Generating one Markdown page per endpoint or tag
- This allows you to:
  - Keep **API reference** docs in sync with the code
  - Link from `API.md` to the detailed pages under `docs/api/`

You can later extend the same pattern to also:

- Regenerate this `AUTO_INDEX.md`
- Output a `docs_index.json` for use in a docs UI or portal

## ✅ Suggested Navigation (MkDocs / Portal)

If you later use MkDocs or another static site generator, a minimal nav could look like:

```yaml
nav:
  - Overview: ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
  - API:
      - API Overview: API.md
      - Endpoints: api/
  - Governance:
      - Governance Playbook: GOVERNANCE_PLAYBOOK.md
      - Policy Profile Schema: SCHEMA_POLICY_PROFILE.md
      - Model Card Template: MODEL_CARD_TEMPLATE.md
      - System Card: SYSTEM_CARD.md
  - Docs Index: AUTO_INDEX.md
```
